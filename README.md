## About
In **Escape Room: Library Labyrinth**, players must escape the library by answering a series of trivia questions.üìöüîç

There are three levels. Easy is the level that was designed for students to navigate, while medium and hard were used to develop my knowledge of API and to make the game more accesible to all who would like the enjoy. 

I made this game through Get Coding as part of my module 1 project.It's been so much fun bringing it to life, and I hope you have as much fun playing it as I did making it.
