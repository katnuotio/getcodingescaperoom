## About
In **Escape Room: Library Labyrinth**, players must escape the library by answering a series of trivia questions.üìöüîç

There are three levels. Easy is the level that was designed for students to navigate. Players are also welcome to challenge themselves with medium and hard levels.

Although medium and hard levels may exceed the capabilities of elementary school students, this project served as a learning experience for me. I aimed to develop a technology that utilizes various aspects of JavaScript, including APIs and multiple question types.

I made this game through Get Coding as part of my module 1 project.It's been so much fun bringing it to life, and I hope you have as much fun playing it as I did making it.
